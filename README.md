# Safe-Zone-Game

Safe Zone is a single-player arcade game that I developed as a personal project.
It is inspired by the classic Table Tennis or Ping Pong game, but with a twist.
The player controls a platform that can move horizontally to hit a bouncing ball.
The ball's direction and position are randomly generated, and its speed increases over time, making the game more challenging.
The player has to prevent the ball from falling off the screen, otherwise they lose a life.
The game ends when the player runs out of lives.
The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible by keeping the ball in play.
I used C# to create the game.
The game showcases my skills in game design, programming, and user interface development.
